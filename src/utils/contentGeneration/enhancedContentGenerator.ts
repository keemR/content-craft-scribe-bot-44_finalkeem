  return `Recognizing the signs and symptoms of this condition requires understanding both obvious manifestations and subtle indicators that are often overlooked. Vitamin D deficiency can affect virtually every system in your body, but the symptoms often develop gradually and may be attributed to other causes.

### Most Common Early Symptoms (Affects 80% of deficient individuals)

**Persistent Fatigue and Low Energy:**
This isn't ordinary tiredness that improves with rest. Vitamin D deficiency fatigue is characterized by feeling exhausted even after adequate sleep, difficulty maintaining energy throughout the day, and a general sense of "heaviness" or lack of vitalityÂ¹.

**Muscle and Bone Pain:**
- **Deep, aching bone pain** particularly in the ribs, spine, pelvis, and legs
- **Muscle weakness** especially in the shoulders and hips (proximal muscle groups)  
- **Joint stiffness** that's worse in the morning and improves with movement
- **Increased fracture risk** from minor falls or normal activities

**Mood Changes and Cognitive Issues:**
- **Depression or persistent low mood** that doesn't respond well to other treatments
- **Anxiety and irritability** without clear external triggers
- **Difficulty concentrating** and "brain fog"
- **Memory problems** and reduced mental clarity

### Frequently Overlooked Signs (Present in 60% of cases)

**Immune System Dysfunction:**
- **Frequent colds, flu, or respiratory infections** (more than 3-4 per year)
- **Slow wound healing** and delayed recovery from illness
- **Increased susceptibility to autoimmune conditions**

**Sleep and Mood Disturbances:**
- **Insomnia or poor sleep quality** despite feeling tired
- **Restless leg syndrome** or muscle cramps at night
- **Seasonal depression** that worsens during winter months

**Hair and Skin Changes:**
- **Hair loss or thinning** particularly in women
- **Slow-healing cuts and bruises**
- **Pale or dull-looking skin**

### Red Flags Requiring Immediate Attention

If you experience multiple symptoms simultaneously, especially bone pain combined with muscle weakness and persistent fatigue, vitamin D deficiency should be investigated promptly. The combination of physical symptoms with mood changes is particularly significant and warrants testing.`;

  return `### When to Get Tested

Vitamin D testing is recommended for anyone experiencing symptoms of deficiency, those with risk factors, or as part of routine health screening for adults over 50.

**Optimal Testing Times:**
- End of winter (February-April) for lowest annual levels
- Before starting supplementation to establish baseline
- 6-8 weeks after beginning treatment to assess response
- Annually for maintenance monitoring

### Understanding Your Test Results

The 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] test is the gold standard for assessing vitamin D status. Here's how to interpret your results:

| Blood Level Range | Status | Clinical Action Required |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Less than 10 ng/mL** | Severe Deficiency | Immediate high-dose intervention required |
| **10-20 ng/mL** | Deficiency | Structured treatment with moderate dosing |
| **20-30 ng/mL** | Insufficiency | Personalized moderate supplementation |
| **30-50 ng/mL** | Optimal Range | Maintenance focus |
| **50-100 ng/mL** | High Normal | Monitor with routine maintenance |
| **Above 100 ng/mL** | Potentially Toxic | Reduce intake and monitor closely |

### What Your Doctor Considers

Healthcare providers evaluate your results alongside:
- **Current symptoms and health status**
- **Geographic location and season**
- **Skin pigmentation and sun exposure habits**
- **Age, weight, and absorption capacity**
- **Medications that may interfere with vitamin D metabolism**
- **Presence of conditions affecting absorption**

### Follow-up Testing Schedule

**Initial Response Check (6-8 weeks):** Confirms your body is responding to treatment and levels are rising appropriately.

**Target Achievement (3-6 months):** Verifies you've reached optimal levels and determines maintenance dosing.

**Long-term Monitoring (Annual):** Ensures stable levels year-round, typically tested during late winter when levels are naturally lowest.`;

// Generate actual prevention and lifestyle content
function generatePreventionAndLifestyleContent(): string {
  return `Prevention of vitamin D deficiency requires a comprehensive, multi-modal approach combining sunlight exposure, dietary strategies, and appropriate supplementation.

### Food Sources and Dietary Approaches

While food alone rarely corrects deficiency, dietary sources provide important baseline support and work synergistically with supplements.

| Food Source | Serving Size | Vitamin D Content (IU) | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Fatty Fish** | | | |
| Salmon (wild-caught) | 3.5 oz | 360-700 IU | Highest natural food source |
| Mackerel | 3.5 oz | 345 IU | Excellent year-round option |
| Sardines (canned) | 3.5 oz | 270 IU | Convenient and affordable |
| **Fortified Foods** | | | |
| Fortified milk | 1 cup | 100-140 IU | Most reliable fortified source |
| Fortified plant milks | 1 cup | 100-140 IU | Good alternative for dairy-free |
| Fortified cereals | 1 cup | 40-100 IU | Check labels for vitamin D3 |
| **Other Sources** | | | |
| Egg yolks (pasture-raised) | 1 large | 20-40 IU | Higher in pasture-raised |
| Mushrooms (UV-exposed) | 1 cup | 400 IU | Maitake and portobello best |
| Cod liver oil | 1 tablespoon | 1,360 IU | Very high but strong taste |

### Safe Sun Exposure Guidelines

Safe sun exposure can contribute significantly to vitamin D production while minimizing skin cancer risk.

**Fair Skin (Types I-II):**
- **Summer:** 10-15 minutes midday sun, 25% body exposed
- **Spring/Fall:** 20-30 minutes midday sun
- **Frequency:** 3-4 times per week

**Medium Skin (Types III-IV):**
- **Summer:** 15-25 minutes midday sun, 25% body exposed
- **Spring/Fall:** 30-45 minutes midday sun
- **Frequency:** 4-5 times per week

**Dark Skin (Types V-VI):**
- **Summer:** 30-60 minutes midday sun, 25% body exposed
- **Year-round:** May need supplementation even with regular sun exposure
- **Frequency:** Daily when possible during peak season

### Supplementation Best Practices

**Choosing the Right Supplement:**
- **Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) vs. D2 (Ergocalciferol):** D3 is 87% more effective at raising blood levels and has a longer half-life. Choose D3 unless specifically prescribed D2.
- **Quality Assurance:** Look for third-party testing seals (USP, NSF, or ConsumerLab) to ensure dosage accuracy and purity.
- **Formulations:** 
  - *Capsules/Tablets:* Most common, stable, easy to dose
  - *Liquid Drops:* Better for children, customizable dosing
  - *Sprays:* Convenient but may have variable absorption

**Optimal Timing and Absorption:**
- **Take with Fat:** Vitamin D absorption increases by 50% when taken with a meal containing 10-15g of fat
- **Consistency:** Take at the same time daily to maintain steady blood levels
- **Cofactors:** Ensure adequate magnesium intake (300-400mg daily) as it's required for vitamin D activation

**Dosing Strategy:**
- **Maintenance (30+ ng/mL):** 1,000-2,000 IU daily
- **Correction (20-30 ng/mL):** 2,000-4,000 IU daily for 8-12 weeks
- **Severe Deficiency (<20 ng/mL):** Medical supervision recommended for doses >4,000 IU daily`;

// Generate actual advanced symptoms content
function generateAdvancedSymptomsSectionContent(): string {
  return `When vitamin D deficiency progresses to severe levels (typically <10 ng/mL), the symptoms become more serious and can involve multiple organ systems, requiring immediate medical intervention.

### Severe Musculoskeletal Complications

**Osteomalacia in Adults:**
Severe bone pain, particularly in the ribs, spine, and pelvis that is constant and deep. Unlike typical back pain, this is a persistent ache that worsens with movement and doesn't improve with rest. The pain is often described as "bone-deep" and can be debilitating.

**Severe Myopathy:**
Proximal muscle weakness affecting shoulders and hips, making it extremely difficult to climb stairs, rise from chairs, or lift arms overhead. This can progress to the point where normal daily activities become impossible without assistance.

**Increased Fracture Risk:**
Bones become so weakened that minor falls or even normal activities like coughing can cause fractures. Hip fractures are particularly common and dangerous in elderly patients with severe deficiency.

### Neurological and Psychiatric Manifestations

**Hypocalcemic Seizures:**
When vitamin D deficiency leads to dangerously low calcium levels, seizures can occur. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate hospitalization and calcium replacement therapy.

**Severe Depression and Cognitive Impairment:**
Beyond mild mood changes, severe deficiency can cause major depression that doesn't respond to standard treatments, and significant memory problems that may be mistaken for early dementia.

**Muscle Cramps and Tetany:**
Painful muscle spasms, particularly in hands and feet, due to critically low calcium levels. These can be severe enough to cause temporary paralysis of affected muscles.

### Cardiovascular and Immune Complications

**Severe Fatigue and Weakness:**
Complete exhaustion that doesn't improve with rest, affecting all daily activities. Patients often describe feeling like they "can't function" or that even simple tasks are overwhelming.

**Recurrent Serious Infections:**
Pneumonia, severe respiratory infections, or other serious infections due to severely compromised immune function. Hospital admissions for infections become more frequent.

**Heart Rhythm Abnormalities:**
Low calcium from severe vitamin D deficiency can affect heart rhythm, potentially causing dangerous arrhythmias that require cardiac monitoring.

### Pediatric Manifestations (Rickets)

**Bone Deformities:**
Bowing of legs, enlarged wrists and ankles, and delayed tooth eruption. These deformities can be permanent if not treated promptly.

**Growth Delays:**
Stunted growth, delayed motor development, and increased susceptibility to respiratory infections.

### Emergency Warning Signs

Seek immediate medical attention if you experience:
- Muscle spasms or seizures
- Difficulty breathing due to chest deformities  
- Severe bone pain that limits mobility
- Signs of heart rhythm abnormalities (chest pain, palpitations, dizziness)

These symptoms may indicate dangerously low calcium levels requiring urgent treatment in a hospital setting.`;

// EXPANDED: Generate comprehensive medical FAQs
function generateExpandedMedicalFAQs(primaryKeyword: string): string {
  if (primaryKeyword.toLowerCase().includes('vitamin d deficiency')) {
    return `### How accurate are at-home vitamin D tests compared to lab tests?

At-home finger-prick tests have approximately 85-90% correlation with laboratory venous blood draws when performed correctly. However, they may be less reliable at very low or very high levels. For initial screening, they're adequate, but for medical decision-making, especially with levels below 20 ng/mL or above 80 ng/mL, laboratory confirmation is recommended.

### Can I take too much vitamin D, and what are the warning signs?

Vitamin D toxicity is rare but serious, typically occurring with sustained intake above 10,000 IU daily for months. Blood levels above 100 ng/mL (250 nmol/L) indicate toxicity risk. This is why doses above 4,000 IU daily should be medically supervised.

### What are the symptoms of taking too much vitamin D?

Vitamin D toxicity symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, kidney problems, confusion, and heart rhythm abnormalities. These occur due to excessive calcium absorption causing hypercalcemia. Symptoms typically appear with blood levels above 100 ng/mL and sustained high-dose supplementation (>10,000 IU daily for months).

### Does vitamin D interact with any medications?

Yes, several medications can affect vitamin D metabolism: Corticosteroids increase breakdown, anticonvulsants induce metabolizing enzymes, thiazide diuretics may cause dangerous calcium elevation when combined with vitamin D, and some cholesterol medications can reduce absorption. Always inform your healthcare provider about vitamin D supplementation.

### What's the difference between Vitamin D2 and D3?

Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is significantly more effective than D2 (ergocalciferol) at raising blood levels. Studies show D3 is approximately 87% more potent and has a longer half-life. While D2 can correct deficiency, D3 requires lower doses and provides more stable blood levels.

### Why isn't my vitamin D level improving despite taking supplements?

Several factors can impair absorption: 1) Taking supplements without fat reduces absorption by 50%, 2) Magnesium deficiency prevents activation, 3) Genetic variations may require higher doses, 4) GI issues reduce absorption, 5) Certain medications interfere with metabolism. If levels don't improve after 8-12 weeks, medical evaluation is warranted.`;
